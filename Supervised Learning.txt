Introduction:
Bank Marketing data is a collection of
41,188 records, related to
direct marketing campaigns
(telephone calls) from a portu banking institution
cheerful.
The purpose of classification is to predict whether the
client will take out a term deposit (variable y)

Step 1. First identify the classes available in the chosen dataset.

Some basic observations:
• We have variables numerical and categorical;
• We have 21 features;
• The goal is to predict whether a person will register (column target 'y');
• It is a binary classification.

Step 2. Explore the dataset and identify values missing, unknown, etc.
Step 3. Develop the correlation matrix
Step 4. Perform train/test split (80-20) of original dataset (seed 44)
Step 5. Using and comparing different models: Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest
Step 6. Calculate Accuracy based on test values
Step 7.The best model for the group of data - Random Forest
Step 8. Using Random Forest for the prediction

Conclusion
• The Random Forest algorithm represents, in our case, the best prediction model, with metrics such that
Accuracy of 98.21%, F-score of 98.27% and a performance evolution of 97.56%.
• The correct way to know the minimum that we must achieve with our models is 50.8%, the precision
nothing
• We must use more than one metric when dealing with unbalanced data. Accuracy is not enough
for the selection of a prediction model.
• F-score is a metric considered important to measure the accuracy of a model because it penalizes the
false negatives.
• According to our model, having type II error (false positive) is more dangerous because we predicted that the
customer is already subscribed to the CIG when it is false because the marketing company will stop contacting him
target customer
